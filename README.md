# Re-Arrange Demo
This page demonstrates drag and drop in HTML5. The first
demo is to re-arrange the phrases in the prayer <a href="ourfather.html"><i>Our Father</i></a>

The phrases are displayed in random order. The user drags and drops the phrases in the right order.
Or, if you are using Adndroid or iPhone click source and destination phrases.

The second demo is for the prayer <a href="hailmary.html"><i>Hail Mary</i></a>.

Added <a href="nginx-phases.html"><i>Nginx Phases</i></a>

This web page can thus be extented to almost any situation where some random order must be rearranged to a well known order.
